2.0
- benchmarks

Can be done in future release without braking backward compatibility
- repeat.invert
- document rotation center behavior on scaling (+translate??)
- example for generating any kind of gradient with specific colors
- take transformations apart from the gradients and cache some of the calculations

Maybe
- color mix. functionality is basically there already
- rgb.setHue:
        let hsv = ColorUtil.rgb.toHsv(this.state.rgb);
        let hueHsv = ColorUtil.rgb.toHsv(hue);
        hsv.h = hueHsv.h;
        let rgb = ColorUtil.hsv.toRgb(hsv);
- radius for circle gradients. undefined = no radius. out of radius values are transparent
- circleMatrixColor by radius and distance instead of x & y
- maybe a shortcut method for getting the grayscale matrix (white, black, hue)
- maybe provide validation and input patterns
