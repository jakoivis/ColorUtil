2.0
- docs
- benchmarks
- fix liearMatrixGradientWithStopExample
- check npm packaging: why the sources are there?

Can be done in future release without braking backward compatibility
- repeat.invert
- document rotation center behavior on scaling (+translate??)
- example for generating any kind of gradient with specific colors
- take transformations apart from the gradients and cache some of the calculations

Maybe
- color mix. functionality is basically there already
- radius for circle gradients. undefined = no radius. out of radius values are transparent
- circleMatrixColor by radius and distance instead of x & y
- maybe a shortcut method for getting the grayscale matrix (white, black, hue)
- maybe provide validation and input patterns
